# Express-Notes


## Description 

We were given starter front end code for an app called note taker to connect to the backend that can write, save, and delete notes. The backend consisted of Express.js and retrieves and modifies data through a parsed JSON file. The app is then further deployed on Heroku.

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following commands (assuming you are on git bash, nodemon, and already have node.js installed):

1. Clone the repository where you want to save the code:  
```
git clone [HTTPS/SSH/CLI link]
``` 

2. Navigate over to files in terminal
3. Type in terminal:  
``` 
npm i
```   
4. Run through node in the terminal:  
``` 
nodemon index.js
``` 

5. Copy the URL link displayed on terminal to either an application like insomnia, or on your browser.

<br/>

NOTE: This is if you want to access the files locally. You can also check out the application on the deployed Heroku link!

## Usage

This program can be used to observe uses of a library that connects backend code to front end code in a full stack developed app. Users can see instances of GET, POST, and DELETE functions of Express, and how it ties in with the front end code.
